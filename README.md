# Sermon

All praise belongs to Allāh, Lord of all the worlds. May peace and blessings be upon our Pophet Muḥammad, upon his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance until the Day of Judgment.

# Introduction

My Python programming is poor and fragmented. I decided to solidify my knowledge and decided to go through all the exercises in *The Python Workbook* by Ben Stephenson available from [Springer](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-18873-3) and probably elsewhere.

This repository is an attempt at (almost) all the questions in the book.

# Note

- Since my knowledge is fragmented, you might see some things used before their introduction in the book.

- You might have better solutions for the problems. If so, open an issue and explain.

- I've avoided writing comments like the author. I'm doing the exercises to improve personally and not teach. I might add comments later if there is significant demand for it. You can all send in pull requests.
